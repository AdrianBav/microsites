					Hello. Thanks for checking out Richard Wooldridge's website. I am he.<br /><br />
					I was born 28<sup>th</sup> February, 1978. My star-sign is Pisces. I had my horoscope
					done by my mum's friend Kath, who is an expert. She said a typical Pisces is
					<br /><br />
					<i>Imaginative and sensitive<br />
					Compassionate and kind<br />
					Selfless and unworldly<br />
					Intuitive and sympathetic</i>

				This is exactly right. I am all of these things. I was a bit annoyed that she hadn't mentioned intelligence
				but when I asked her if Pisces was intelligent she said definitely. I was embarrassed to ask if Pisces are
				good lovers because my mum was in the room, but I know the answer is yes. If any ladies are reading, and want
				to find out if this is true, please e-mail me. If you are a bloke, please do not e-mail me pretending to be
				a lady who is up for it. <br />(I'm bored of that rubbish).

				I am chief photocopier in a controls company in coventry, which is
				quite close to where I live. If you need anything photocopying,
				please e-mail me. (No time wasters.	I'm too busy).
				<br /><br />
				My life is like Ibiza Uncut. I have been known to party until 3am and
				then get up at 7am to go to work WITHOUT A HANGOVER!!! (Never get
				hangovers, don't believe in them.) My defence, your honour, is that
				I have the maddest mates this side of a mental home.
