            <ul>
                <li>A website built to the clients specification to showcase their business. The business lists a variety of personalized vehicle registration plates for sale.</li>
                <li>A jQuery &acute;Image Carousel&acute; plugin was used as the basis of the rotating registration plates widget shown in the screen shot. The plugin was customized to match the clients visual requirements and its code modified to allow iPad touch gestures to control it.</li>
                <li>The text, image and form content of the website is stored in a database on the server. The pages are created dynamically by PHP on loading. This allows the client to make simple updates via an interface to the database without having to edit any HTML code.</li>
