            <h3>Data Capture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed code to automatically capture and store data from a series of specified websites that provide soccer match data on a regular basis.</li>
                <li>Processed the data previously captured using specially developed algorithms as outlined by the client.</li>
                <li>Implemented the back end data capture side of the project in a modular format using Python. Used unit testing to ensure the integrity of the code.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Graphical Display of Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a web based application to allow the client to view the processed data.</li>
                <li>Developed a JSON structure to fetch back data from the server to the web application.</li>
                <li>Data is fetched back every couple of seconds and at peak times, a high number of soccer matches can take place simultaneously creating large data packets.</li>
                <li>Used Javascript over jQuery to make frequent DOM updates to the web application without any stuttering or flickering.</li>
                <li>Added the ability for website users to create and log into their personal accounts to customize various aspects of the website and save their settings.</li>
