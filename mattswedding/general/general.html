				<div class="subtitle">The Plan:</div>
					DATE: Saturday 2nd August.<br />
					TIME: Ceremony 2.45pm. Reception 4.30pm(ish).<br />
					<br />
					Basically, the wedding reception is going to be in a field, on a campsite.<br />
					The plan is for as many people as possible to camp on the Saturday, after the reception.<br />
					But we'd love people to come and camp on the Friday night too.<br />
					<br />
					You may get roped into helping put up the marquee, etc, <br />
					but we're also intending to light a barbeque, play rounders, have sack races and other general silliness!<br />
					So it should be fun.<br />
					(And, of course, you'll be free on Saturday to explore the beautiful countryside,
					find a nice pub, etc, etc, before the celebrations begin.)<br />
					<br />
					If you're up for the Friday night, arrive anytime after lunch.<br />
					(If you're not the camping type and you don't fancy giving it a go, we've added a list of B&amp;Bs.
					But it won't be as much fun!!!)

			<tr><td>
				<div class="subtitle">Camping:</div>
				For those that are not used to camping.  A few tips:<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Bring either a blow up mattress or a duvet or two to lie on.</li>
					<li>Bring loads and loads and loads of thin layers and bedding, so, as the sun (hopefully) disappears from view you can start to pile on the layers and dem darn tents get cold in the depths of night.</li>
					<li>Bring something waterproof and wellies.</li>
					<li>There are no fridges in tents, so think about the food for Friday, mornings, snacks, etc.</li>
					<li>There is drinking water, toilets and showers on the campsite. We are sorting a power point out in the bathrooms for girls and their technological beauty machines!!!</li>
					<li>It gets dark in the middle of nowhere. Us city folks are used to light pollution wherever we go, so bring a torch (and spare batteries)!</li>
				</ul>

		<!-- tariff -->
		<table class="tableGeneral">
			<tr><td>
				<div class="subtitle">Tariff:</div>
				<b>TENTS:</b> The charge for camping in a tent is &pound;5 per tent per night.<br />
				If you can squeeze 10 into your tent then that'll be 50p per person per night, though probably not very comfy!<br />
				There is no need to contact the campsite, we have booked the whole field.  So just turn up.<br />
				One of our guests (probably one of the bigger ones) will collect the money on the day.<br />
				<br />
				<b>CARAVANS:</b> There are limited places for caravans and therefore you will have to contact the farm direct
				on 01538 304252 or 07919 964 968.<br />
				Please state that you are with the wedding party.<br />
				The charge is &pound;12.50 per night (which includes your electrics).

					There is none.<br />
					We will be in our smart togs (big fluffy wedding dress and all!),

			<tr><td>
				<div class="subtitle">Help:</div>
					We want this to be a real community effort.<br />
					So any help that anyone wants to give would be really appreciated.<br />
					<br />
					Friday night will be a hive of activity putting up tents, fairy lights etc.<br />
					Any extra pairs of hands would be great.<br />
					<br />
					We are providing a big pig to eat.<br />
					It's a big spit roast (mmm).<br />
					Don't worry vegicide people, we will be sorting  non-pig-based food out for you.<br />
					But if you want to bake a cake, toss a salad, puree some chick peas etc. and bring them along as extra bits to nibble on, that'd be great.<br />
					(Don't forget, there are no fridges!)<br />
					<br />
					Just let us know, so we don't have 44 Eccles Cakes and 14 gallons of houmus!
