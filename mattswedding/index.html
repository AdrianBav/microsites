			Hello everyone! As you may know by now this is not going to be the normal "run-of-the-mill" type wedding reception.<br />
			It's still going to involve all the good stuff like: food, booze
			(bring your own, there is no bar in the field and there are no off-licenses near by!!),
			dancing and cake.<br />
			<br />
			But we're doing it all in a field 1300 feet up.  And then crashing in our tents!!!<br />
			<br />
			Because there is going to be a lot more organising than the usual hotel to book, <br />
			we thought we'd ask Adrian to wave his techno-wand and put together this little website for us.<br />
			<br />
